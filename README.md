hello-world repository
I am a computer science student, I have started this repository as a part of one of my assignments of CS-HU 250 class, Introduction to Version Control. I like this class and the deep level of understanding that it offers. Before, I had a basic understanding of Git from one of my previous classes and knew how it is an important skill that each developer should learn.
